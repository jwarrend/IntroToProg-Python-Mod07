# Module07 Pickle and Try Catch

## Introduction
   In this paper, I will be talking about  using try/except block and pickling data with python.
   
## Pickle data 

<sub> To begin, pickling in python is used to serialize and de-serialize object structures. Pickling allows for transferring data from one server to the other. It can then be stored in a file or on a data base. I created two functions to save and read data from a file using pickle dump.

 ## Try/Except block
  
 
This particular coding is used to handle errors within our python code. The try block executes when there are no errors. If an error is found, the exception sends   out and error message. This can be a custom error message. I added a try/except block that gives an error message if the incorrect type is entered.
